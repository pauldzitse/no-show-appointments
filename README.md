### Project title: No-Show Appointments


### Project description


In this project, we worked to understand what factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment or not.  The dataset comprises information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil. The project is one of the requirements that needs to be fulfilled in the Udacityâ€™s Data Analyst nanodegree programme.
